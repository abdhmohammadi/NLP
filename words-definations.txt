CORPUS


In **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, a **corpus** (plural: **corpora**) refers to:

> **A large and structured collection of texts (or speech data) used for linguistic analysis and training machine learning models.**

---

### üîç More Specifically:

* A **corpus** is the **raw material** for NLP.
* It can contain:

  * Books
  * Articles
  * Transcripts
  * Webpages
  * Tweets, dialogues, emails, etc.
* It‚Äôs often **annotated** (e.g., with part-of-speech tags, named entities, syntactic structure).

### üì¶ Examples of Common NLP Corpora:

| Corpus Name        | Description                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Brown Corpus**   | 1 million words of American English          |
| **Penn Treebank**  | Annotated corpus with syntax and POS tags    |
| **Wikipedia Dump** | Used for training large language models      |
| **CoNLL-2003**     | Labeled dataset for Named Entity Recognition |
| **IMDB Reviews**   | Movie reviews for sentiment analysis         |

---

### üß† Applications of Corpora

* **Training** language models (like GPT, BERT)
* **Evaluating** NLP systems
* **Analyzing** language use and structure
* **Creating** dictionaries, parsers, summarizers, etc.

The term **"corpus"** in the context of linguistics and NLP has its roots in **Latin**, meaning *"body"*, and was used historically to refer to a **body of written texts**. Its use in **modern computational linguistics and NLP** became formalized in the **mid to late 20th century**, especially with the rise of **corpus linguistics** as a field.

## üß≠ Historical Timeline

### üìö **Pre-computational Use**

* The concept of a "corpus" predates computers.
* In traditional linguistics, a corpus was simply a **collection of texts** used to study a language.
* Examples: *Corpus Juris Civilis* (body of civil law), *Corpus Christi* (body of Christ).

### üíª **Modern Computational Corpus**

The **first computer-readable corpus** is widely acknowledged to be the:

### ‚úÖ **Brown Corpus (1961‚Äì1964)**

* **Defined and compiled by**:
  **Henry Kuƒçera** (Czech-American linguist) and **W. Nelson Francis** (American linguist).
* **Institution**: Brown University, USA.
* **Content**: 1 million words of written American English from 500 texts published in 1961.
* **Significance**:

  * First systematically sampled and tagged digital corpus.
  * Used for early experiments in computational linguistics and NLP.
  * Became a **gold standard** in corpus linguistics and inspired many later corpora.

## üîç When "Corpus" Became an NLP Standard

The widespread **formal use of "corpus"** in NLP started:

* In the **1980s‚Äì1990s**, with the rise of statistical NLP.
* When researchers needed **large-scale language data** to train and evaluate machine learning models.
* Tools like **NLTK**, **WordNet**, and later **Hugging Face Datasets** made corpora central to NLP workflows.
