# NLP Fundamentals with Practical Implementations

This repository offers a hands-on exploration of fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Through practical examples implemented in Jupyter Notebooks, it demonstrates how to preprocess text, analyze linguistic features, and extract meaningful information using popular NLP libraries.

## Overview

This project covers a wide range of NLP tasks, including:

- Text preprocessing
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization and stemming
- Stopwords removal
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
<!--
- Topic modeling
- Sentiment analysis
-->
Using libraries such as Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, and NLTK, this repository provides insights into the practical application of these techniques, with content that will be completed over time.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into tokens using Hugging Face's BERT tokenizer.
- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base forms with spaCy.
- **Stemming**: Simplifying words to their root forms using NLTK's PorterStemmer.
- **Stopwords Removal**: Eliminating common words that may not add significant meaning.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities like names, organizations, and dates using spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers.
<!-- 
- **Topic Modeling**: Discovering abstract topics within text data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assessing the emotional tone behind a body of text.
