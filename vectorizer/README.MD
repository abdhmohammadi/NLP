## Text Vectorization Methods

This notebook demonstrates the basic concepts of building a basic text vectorizer **from scratch**, without using external libraries like `scikit-learn` or `transformers`. It then explores traditional and advanced methods for a deeper understanding. If you are interested, a brief history of its emergence is also provided in [Text vectorization history](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdhmohammadi/NLP/blob/main/vectorizer/History.html).

## ðŸ“Œ What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to preprocess text (lowercase + punctuation removal)
- How to tokenize text into words
- How to build a vocabulary from a dataset
- How to encode words into numbers
- How to decode numbers back into words
- How to handle unknown or unseen words


## ðŸ§° Requirements

This project uses only the Python standard library.

âœ… No external packages required.

## ðŸ“˜ For Educators

This project is intentionally written without high-level libraries to **teach students the fundamentals** of:

* Vocabulary building
* Tokenization logic
* How NLP models understand text as numbers

---

## âœ… Next Steps

Students can extend this project by:

* Adding stopword removal
* Using frequency thresholds for vocabulary
* Creating n-gram tokenizers
* Moving from word-level to subword-level tokenization
